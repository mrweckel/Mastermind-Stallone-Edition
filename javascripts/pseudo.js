// PSEUDOCODE

// Create board interface that allows user to choose colors and see it updated on the board...
  //Draggable?? sure

// Create peg objects
    //of six varying colors
    //each time a new peg is needed, a new object is created
    // Make sure red and white pegs are separate

// MVC style
  // Peg models
  // Controller
  // View: Update board. Allow user to update board


// Create new game button that automatically creates winning combination and puts it at the top of the page ---for now---

//Have choices of color placed on the side of the page and user can drag and drop over to board. for now-- once they complete a row the response will automatically be given.
  //once row is completed, array will be created.
  //that array will be checked against the main array
      //1st for correct color and location. Then those colors will be pushed from array, and then
      //2nd for correct color only checked against remaining pegs in the array

// Create  a run page that will call all of the methods being created in my OOJS world.
